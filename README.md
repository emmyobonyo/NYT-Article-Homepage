# New York Times Article Clone.

This is a clone of the New York Times Article Page (https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0)

- The goal of the project was to be able to master floating and positioning principles, mainly using Flexbox.

- The page (clone) has a navigaiton that was built with Flexbox in order to positing the elements properly.

- There is also main section that includes some images, embeded videos and some texts describing in more detail what the article is about. Care to read :)

- There is also a footer section that contains links to various pages around the Website.

- PS: The links on this page (clone) don't work. They are mainly dummy links intended for learning purposes.
